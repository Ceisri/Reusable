update 16/07/2024

What I added/changed:

-Assasinations where you get enemies from behind and slice their throat

-Lift, carry, put down, throw objects or downed enemies

-Huge performance boost to the inventory system, on my trash computer 500 inventory slots aren't even noticeable.

-Improved harvesting 

-Improved UI

-Improved crouching, added sneaking, now you can use both to move on tight place 

-Double jump 

-Add UI animations, icons and buttons or inventories and such popping up when taking damage, clicking stuff or receiving items

Scope creep is getting out of hand since I also have to clean up and add a lot of assets, mostly shaders and animations...but the last system I might implement is something easy, a button that when pressed turns your camera to face the closest enemy since people playing on phones might have difficulties aiming, it's not tab target since it simply rotates your camera once when pressed.
