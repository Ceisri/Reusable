Scope creep is getting out of hand since I also have to clean up and add a lot of assets, mostly shaders and animations...but the last system I might implement is something easy, a button that when pressed turns your camera to face the closest enemy since people playing on phones might have difficulties aiming, it's not tab target since it simply rotates your camera once when pressed.
